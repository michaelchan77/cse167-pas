# HW 3 Submission 11/19/23

I implemented two bonuses: 3_3 textures and 3_4 lighting animation. Recorded scenes for both bonuses can be found in the hw_3_3_outputs folder.

# Build
All the dependencies are included. Use CMake to build.
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/BachiLi/balboa_public mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```
It requires compilers that support C++17 (gcc version >= 8, clang version >= 7, Apple Clang version >= 11.0, MSVC version >= 19.14).

### For Windows users:
1. Install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Choose "Desktop development with C++" and check "C++ CMake tools for Windows" on the recipe. 
2. `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/BachiLi/balboa_public`
3. `cd balboa_public; mkdir build; cd build`
4. `cmake ..`
5. At this point, you can either open up the `balboa.sln` in `build` folder and use Visual Studio as your IDE, or work with Visual Studio Code. 

(optional) To build, run, and debug in VS Code: 

1. In the bottom bar, configure CMake as follows (from left to right): 
    - Build variant: `RelWithDebInfo`. 
    - Active kit: `Visual Studio ... x64`, choose the appropriate one depending on your architecture. 
    - Default build target: `balboa`. 
2. Create a `launch.json` in `.vscode` folder: 
    ```
    {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "name": "hw1_1", 
                "type": "cppvsdbg", 
                "request": "launch", 
                "program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/${command:cmake.buildType}/balboa.exe",
                "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/build/${command:cmake.buildType}", 
                "args": ["-hw", "1_1"]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
    You can pass arguments using `args`. 
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+D` to start the debugger. You can set breakpoints, inspect variables, and trace callstack, etc. 

# Run
Try 
```
cd build
./balboa -hw 1_1
```
This will generate an image "hw1_1.png".
